# About
• The whole idea of this skill is get the current running live status of a train by asking "Where is my train". 
• To make it a bit more user friendly, I have divided this skill into two parts 
		a) Setting up the train the user generally commute daily. As an analogy, one can think about like adding to favorites. (This is basicaly a mapping of Alexa User Session id with the Train number in the database).
		b) Next time onwards, he just need to invoke the skill and ask "Where is my train" and the response will be like "Your train has just crossed  Bangalore and is running late by 20 minutes".
		c) Note:- Future enhancement of this skill - User shall receive a push notification through Alexa when the train crosses a specific station - which is captured during the setup process. Once Alexa push notifications are ready, user will get a notification like "Wake up, your train has crossed Ernakulam Junction". 
# Usage
Alexa, ask mat train.
	>> "Welcome. Please say set up to set up your train".
